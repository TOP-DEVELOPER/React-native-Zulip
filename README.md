# Zulip Mobile
**NOTE: VERY EARLY PROOF OF CONCEPT (NOT USABLE)**

Zulip Mobile is a new, experimental mobile client written in Javascript with React Native. The current goal is to assess whether React Native makes sense as a long-term direction for the mobile apps.

It will initially target iOS only (although most of the code will be cross-platform).

## Why React Native?
Pros:
* Support iOS and Android with one codebase
* Familar web programming model (React + Javascript + Flexbox)

Cons:
* Potential performance issues
* Greater technical risk (new ecosystem, not as battle-tested as native code)

## Development

Please see the [developer guide](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/tree/master/docs/developer-guide.md).
