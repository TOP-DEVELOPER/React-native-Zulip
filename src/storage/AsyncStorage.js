// TODO: This needs a migration strategy!  How do we move the user's data
//   from the old AsyncStorage to the new database?
//
//   On Android, we could bypass this by arranging to use the old thing's
//   database and table name.  Might need some tweaking of expo-sqlite in
//   order to control the database name fully enough.
//
//   But on iOS, it's not so simple.  Values over 1024 characters
//   (RCTInlineValueThreshold, in RNCAsyncStorage.m) are written as separate
//   files.  Values up to that threshold go into a single JSON blob (for the
//   whole key-value store) that's written as one file.  So really our
//   sanest path is probably to keep the legacy AsyncStorage as a dependency
//   indefinitely, and use it to read the old data if the new doesn't exist.
//
//   Then once we're doing that for iOS, might as well do it for Android
//   too, and not have to follow the old names.

// A better name for this class might be simply AsyncStorage.
// But for now we reserve that name for the thing that's a (nearly) drop-in
// replacement for the upstream AsyncStorage, which isn't this class itself
// but rather an instance of it.

  // than unwrapping it up front and wrapping it in a new Promise on each call.

/**
 * A sound, nearly-drop-in replacement for RN's AsyncStorage.
 *
 * The methods should be invoked as methods, like `AsyncStorage.foo()`.
 *
 * Under that convention, and for the methods it has, this is a perfectly
 * drop-in replacement for the upstream AsyncStorage, meaning that it will
 * always satisfy the spec for how the upstream AsyncStorage behaves.
 *
 * The difference is that it also satisfies a tighter spec: each operation
 * either happens completely or not at all.  No operation corrupts the
 * database or has only partial effect, even if the process is killed or
 * encounters I/O errors.
 *
 * This is accomplished by using SQLite, and doing each operation in a
 * transaction.  The upstream AsyncStorage does the same thing on Android;
 * but on iOS, it uses an ad-hoc database which is susceptible to complete
 * corruption if interrupted.
 *
 * (If one pokes around other than by invoking the methods as methods, this
 * implementation has incidental other differences: these are real methods
 * that come from a prototype and use `this`, while the upstream
 * AsyncStorage is a plain object with functions as its own properties.)
