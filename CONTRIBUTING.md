## Contributing

* **Start** by reading our
[developer guide](docs/developer-guide.md).

* **Review** [open issues][open-issues] and submit a pull request.

* **Follow** the [commit discipline][commit-discipline] of the Zulip server project.

* **Pull requests**. Before a pull request can be merged, you need to
sign the [Dropbox Contributor License Agreement][cla]. Also,
have a look at our [commit message style guidelines][doc-commit-style].

And please make sure to format the whole code using the command `tools/fmt`.
This will format the code using our Prettier setup.

* **Issues**. Before working on an issue make sure to claim it.  To do
  so, leave a comment on the GitHub issue thread like "I'm working on
  this issue and would like to claim it."  Conversely, if someone else
  is working on an issue then try looking for a different issue to
  work on instead.
