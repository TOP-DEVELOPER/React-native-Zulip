/**
 * # Babel, core-js and polyfills
 *
 * The `@babel/preset-env` package relies on the definitions and compatibility
 * declarations in `core-js` to select polyfills for rollup to include.
 *
 * Alas, this induces problems.
 *
 * The `core-js` package is dedicated to 100% compatibility, even on very old
 * (ES3) engines. This means that its compatibility profile includes polyfills
 * for marginal (read: irrelevant) functionality like `@@species` support
 * [c#644].
 *
 * Furthermore, the compatibility table checks aren't run recursively on the
 * dependencies of those polyfills; instead, the polyfills' dependencies are
 * polyfilled automatically. [t] `core-js`'s feature-detection _should_ prevent
 * these unnecessary polyfills from actually attaching to global objects; but
 * Rollup is entirely oblivious to this, and will (as directed by `core-js`)
 * cheerfully push into the final bundle all sorts of unnecessary-but-
 * `require()`d polyfills containing all sorts of support functionality that,
 * due to their runtime checks, can't be tree-shaken away. [c#388]
 *
 * It is possible to exclude individual polyfills on an item-by-item basis
 * [b.excl]; but this will only block detection at the top level by
 * @babel/preset-env. Even `core-js`'s own exclusion system [c.cloa] will not
 * honor internal polyfill block requests. [c#388]
 *
 * It's bad enough that `core-js` inflates the bundle with things like IE8- bug
 * workarounds [t] [c#388] and unstripped comments [t], and that it replaces
 * fast, sufficient native code with complex, less-JITtable code. Worse, though,
 * is that its aggressive replacement of native functionality can introduce
 * slowdown even on formally-unrelated code paths. [b#5771] [c#306]
 *
 * For all that, `core-js` _does_ work. Using it, or not using it, is a
 * tradeoff... but then, so is supporting older WebViews at all.
 *
 * See the comments heading `js.js` for details about our version-support
 * strategy.
